# SketchUp-Components 

This is a collection of components that I started 
1) as a learning project to get to know how to use SketchUp 
2) to create a MMCNC (Mostly Metal) router. 

These components were made with SketchUp v. 8.0

The MMCNC router design was made using this set of components and it is added as an example. I am planning to build a prototype of this setup in the future. So, before you start building it yourself. Keep in mind that this is just a brain dump, not a workable plan for a guaranteed perfectly working machine. Also the motor mount for the router is missing because I do not have the dimensions for a router yet. 
I started the design of the MMCNC router after viewing a video from Thomas Sanladerer,

Before watching that video I had plans to start building the MPCNC router and was looking for people with experience in building that router. After I saw Toms video, I decided to drop the idea and start from scratch.
